Install Ansible on a designated server and configure a cluster with passwordless SSH authentication for a specific user.

1.Task: Create an Ansible playbook that installs the latest version of nginx on a group of web servers. Start and enable the nginx service.

2.Task: Utilize Ansible variables in a playbook to configure a common setting, such as the document root for the nginx server. Test the playbook on a few hosts.

3.Task: Organize your previous playbook into an Ansible role. Use this role to configure the web servers.

4.Task: Set up a dynamic inventory script to dynamically discover and manage a group of servers. Use the dynamic inventory in a playbook.

5.Task: Create an Ansible playbook that configures a service and restarts it only when necessary using handlers. Test the playbook on multiple hosts.

6.Task: Enhance a playbook with conditional statements to perform different tasks based on the operating system. Test the playbook on hosts with different OS types.

7.Task: Modify a playbook to include error handling mechanisms. Test the playbook with intentional errors and ensure it gracefully handles failures.

8.Task: Use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive information such as passwords or API keys in a playbook. Decrypt the information during playbook execution.

9.Task: Create a multi-playbook workflow where the first playbook sets up a base configuration, and subsequent playbooks depend on the success of the previous ones. Test the workflow on multiple hosts.

10.Task: Develop a custom Ansible module to perform a specific task (e.g., interacting with an API, checking system status). Integrate the custom module into a playbook and execute it on target hosts.

11.Task: Modify a playbook to execute tasks in parallel on multiple hosts. Test and analyze the performance improvements.

12.Task: Use Ansible to template a configuration file for a service (e.g., Apache, MySQL). Ensure the template is customizable and deploy it to multiple hosts.

13.Task: Write an Ansible playbook to deploy a Docker container on target hosts. Include tasks for pulling an image, exposing ports, and defining volumes.

14.Task: Automate the provisioning of EC2 instances using Ansible. Include tasks such as creating security groups, attaching volumes, and configuring instances dynamically.

15.Task: Integrate Ansible playbooks into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI). Demonstrate how changes trigger automated deployments.

16.Task: Configure logging and monitoring on target hosts using Ansible. Use roles or playbooks to set up tools like ELK stack or Prometheus.

17.Task: Write Ansible playbooks to dynamically scale infrastructure based on demand. This could involve adding or removing servers from a load balancer.

18.Task: Review an existing Ansible playbook with minimal documentation and comments. Enhance the playbook by adding comprehensive comments and documentation.

19.Task: Set up a Git repository for an Ansible project. Demonstrate how to version control playbooks, roles, and inventory. Include a commit and push as part of the assessment.

20.Task: Create an Ansible playbook that dynamically assigns variables based on host characteristics (e.g., OS type, available memory). Use these variables to customize the configuration.

21.Task: Explore and use Ansible Collections to extend functionality. Integrate a community or custom collection into a playbook for additional features.

22.Task: Securely manage sensitive information using HashiCorp Vault integration in Ansible. Create a playbook that retrieves secrets from Vault during execution.

23.Task: Apply Ansible for network automation. Create a playbook to configure network devices (e.g., routers, switches) with specific settings.

24.Task: Extend Ansible skills to automate tasks on Windows servers. Write a playbook to perform actions such as installing software or configuring settings on Windows machines.

25.Task: Demonstrate advanced variable manipulation techniques in Ansible. Use filters, Jinja2 expressions, and other methods to transform and manipulate variables within playbooks.

26.Task: Implement security best practices for an Ansible environment. This could include securing communication, restricting access, and using Ansible Vault for sensitive data.

27.Task: Develop a custom callback plugin for Ansible. Customize the output format or integrate with external systems for reporting.

28.Task: Extend Ansible playbooks to support multi-cloud deployments. Deploy resources on both AWS and Azure, demonstrating flexibility in infrastructure management.
