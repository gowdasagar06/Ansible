    <h1>Multi-Playbook Workflow on Ansible</h1>
    <p>
        Ansible allows you to organize your automation tasks into multiple playbooks, creating a workflow for managing your infrastructure efficiently.
    </p>
    <h2>Workflow Overview</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Base Configuration:</strong> The first playbook sets up a base configuration for your servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Subsequent Playbooks:</strong> Subsequent playbooks depend on the success of the previous ones and perform specific tasks such as upgrading packages, installing software, or deploying applications.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Playbooks can be organized based on functionality, making it easier to manage and maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Playbooks can be reused across different environments or projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependency Management:</strong> Playbooks can define dependencies between tasks, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Example Workflow</h2>
    <p>
        Here's an example of a multi-playbook workflow:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Base Configuration:</strong> Sets up the initial server configuration, including user accounts, SSH keys, and basic security settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Upgrade Packages:</strong> Ensures all packages are up-to-date by running system updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Install Nginx:</strong> Installs the Nginx web server to serve web content.</li>
        <li><strong>Deploy Application:</strong> Copies application files to the server and configures Nginx to serve the application.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This workflow can be customized based on your specific requirements and infrastructure setup.
