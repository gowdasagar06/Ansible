    <h1>Deploying a Docker Container on Target Hosts</h1>
    <p>This document outlines the steps to deploy a Docker container on target hosts using Ansible.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Pull Docker Image</h2>
    <p>The first step is to pull the Docker image from a Docker repository. This image contains the necessary software and configurations for the container.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Expose Ports</h2>
    <p>Next, we expose ports on the Docker container to allow external access to services running inside the container. Ports can be mapped from the container to the host system.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Define Volumes</h2>
    <p>Volumes are used to persist data between container restarts and to share data between the container and the host system. Define volumes to store important data and configurations.</p>

    <h2>Sample Ansible Playbook</h2>
    <pre>
        <code>
- name: Deploy Docker Container
  hosts: target_hosts
  tasks:
    - name: Pull Docker image
      docker_image:
        name: "nginx:latest"
        state: present

    - name: Run Docker container
      docker_container:
        name: my_nginx_container
        image: "nginx:latest"
        state: started
        ports:
          - "8080:80"
        volumes:
          - "/path/to/local/html:/usr/share/nginx/html"
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Replace <code>target_hosts</code> with the hosts where you want to deploy the Docker container. Adjust the image name, port mappings, and volume paths according to your requirements.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following these steps and using Ansible, you can efficiently deploy Docker containers on target hosts, ensuring consistency and reliability in your infrastructure.</p>
